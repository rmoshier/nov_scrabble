# self.highest_score_from(array_of_words) returns the word in the array with the
  # highest score.
  
  # Note that itâ€™s better to use fewer tiles, so if the top score is tied between
    # multiple words, pick the one with the fewest letters.
  # But there is a bonus for using all seven letters. If one of the highest scores
    # uses all seven letters, pick that one
  # But if the there are multiple words that are the same score and same length,
    # pick the first one in supplied list`
